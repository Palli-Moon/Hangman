Hangman
=======
Hangman is a little console game that I created mainly to practice git and vim.

#How to play
The player writes the letters he wants to guess until either he's got the whole word or he loses when he's guessed wrong too often. If you don't know the rules of hangman you really should move away from Antartica.

In this version of the game the player writes the letter he wants to guess and presses the **enter** key. The player can write more than once letter before pressing enter, although this is not recommended, since it's best to see if your guess was wrong or right before guessing again. If the player is certain he knows what the phrase/word is, guessing the missing letters in one go can speed things up.

All the phrases/words are currently stored in the **mistery.txt** file, which can be edited at will. The game does not need to be recompiled afterwards, just restarted.

Enjoy my shitty game! :D

#Planned features
* **Will switch to ncurses for "graphics"**
* More difficulty levels
* Different categories of phrases/words (even quotes?)
* Menus the player can navigate through
* A more complete file system
* Perhaps more ascii art
* Cupcakes

#Known bugs
* The guesses are case-sensitive, although all the answers are in lower-case.
